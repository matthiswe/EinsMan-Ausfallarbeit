# EinsMan-Prediction
## Prediction of renewable energy losses based on EinsMan 

# Introduction
Since the modern energy market is a very complex system there is a need for regularization within the system. In order to protect  individual sections of a distribuiton or transmission network from an overload a curtailment of the energy fed in becomes necessary. This overall management of the failure work is called EinsMan. To predict this regulated failure work is the main goal of this project.
